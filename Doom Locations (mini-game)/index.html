    <p class="h2 mt-5 intro">Enter the correct name of the locations. Click 'Change the location!' button to change the location. Below are the description of the locations that will give you an idea about what the location in the image could be.</p>

    
    <p class="h4 location mt-5">Earth:</p>
    <p class="text-white fs-5">Earth is invaded and overrun by the forces of Hell. Over 60% of the planet has been consumed by the demons and the majority of the human population have been killed in the first month of the Hell invasion, following the catastrophic failure of virtually every man-made system.Large portions of Earth's environment and atmosphere are rendered extremely inhospitable due to demonic corruption, as cancerous Hellgrowth infestations accelerated the hostile terraformation of the planet and creating Hell portals for demons to travel to Earth. The damage to Earth does not limit itself to the planet's surface--the moon has been partially destroyed, with portions of it forming a ring of debris around Earth.</p>
    
    <p class="h4 location mt-3">Sentinel Prime:</p>
    <p class="text-white fs-5">Sentinel Prime appears to have a cascadian landscape alike most other Sentinel cities, and appears to be within a subarctic temperate region, dominated by vast mountains and conifer forests. A single moon is visible in the sky, with a reddish surface colour not unlike Mars. At the heart of the city lies the gladitorial arena, where the champions of yore would fight mighty battles, and where condemned criminals were offered a chance for pardon though trial by combat.</p>

    <p class="h4 location mt-3">Urdak:</p>
    <p class="text-white fs-5">It has been stated that although Urdak appears of an angelic origin, it's still a technologically-driven domain.Urdak's name is said to match words for "paradise" or "heaven" in hundreds of different languages throughout the universe.Urdak exists in an anchor state, locked in a static position relative to other dimensions at a sub-quantum level using advanced technology.</p>

    <p class="h4 location mt-3">Taras Nabad:</p>
    <p class="text-white fs-5">The city of Taras Nabad was the crown jewel of Argent D'Nur. For centuries it served as the spiritual heart of Argent society, home to both the royal family and the center of political power. No expense was spared in the building of the city, with bold colonnaded architecture and towering monuments to gods and kings resplendent on every avenue. The city was ground zero of a massive demonic invasion attempt, and although the invasion was thwarted, this attack changed Argenta society forever. The cityâ€™s ruins are filled with remnants of its past glory, juxtaposed with the devastation brought by the demonic invasion.</p>

    <p class="h4 location mt-3">Fortress of Doom:</p>
    <p class="text-white fs-5">The Fortress of Doom is a space station used by the Doom Slayer as his personal headquarters. It was designed by the people of Argent D'Nur, but built around a core of Maykr technology, originally intended as a base of operations for the Night Sentinels. It's implied to be one of many such structures, though the fate of the others is unknown. VEGA describes it as a "flag-station," implying it is a particularly large or well-equipped example of a Sentinel warship. The Fortress is not technically a spaceship as it has no conventional engines. Instead, it uses an unknown form of space-folding technology based on Sentinel Energy to reposition itself while remaining stationary.</p>

    <p class="h4 location mt-3">Nekravol:</p>
    <p class="text-white fs-5">Nekravol is a massive Maykr facility in Hell, located at the center of the city. The structure serves as a processing center which sorts, torments, and extracts the souls from its victims in order to produce an endless supply of Argent Energy.</p>
