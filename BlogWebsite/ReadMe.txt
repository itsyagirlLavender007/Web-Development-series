A Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. 
The application will allow users to create and view blog posts. 
Posts will not persist between sessions as no database will be used in this version of the application.
Styling added is minimal as it's a practice project for Node.js, Express.js and EJS.
Will be adding a way to delete posts.
